    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "Ans: Class: In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects (an instance of the class). It defines a set of attributes and behaviors that an object of that class will have. A class can be considered as a blueprint for the object or objects that can be created using it.\n",
    "Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity with attributes and behaviors that are defined by the class. An object has a state and a behavior, and it is created from a class. An object is also known as an instance of a class.\n",
    "Example: Let's consider a class called \"Car\". A Car class might have attributes such as color, make, model, and year, and behaviors such as start, stop, and drive. An object of the Car class would be a specific car, such as a red 2022 Toyota Corolla. The red 2022 Toyota Corolla would have the attributes of color (red), make (Toyota), model (Corolla), and year (2022), and it would be able to perform the behaviors start, stop, and drive."
